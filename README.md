Bank app that has help me understand Array methods
-Bankist is a fictional online bank. It is a project introduced by Jonas Schmedtmann in order to practice DOM manipulation, array Methods, and user interaction. Bankist has the option to log in to the account and use different functionalities, almost like in an actual bank!

WHAT I LEARNED FROM BUILDING THIS APP
-I learned a vast number of array methods ranging from push(),unshift(),splice(),from(),forEach(), map(),filter(),slice(),includes() ,every(),some(),find(),reduce(),findIndex(),indexOf(),flat(),join(),shift() ,reverse(),sort(),splice(),fill() and pop().
-I learned how to chain different methods in a statement.
-implementing a callback function several times has expanded my knowledge of arrow functions and callback functions.
WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THIS APP
-You can transfer money to other users using their user names and amount
-You can request a load and your dashboard will be updated instantly with the requested amount if you meet a certain condition
-You can also sort the transactions by clicking on the sort icon bottom right.
-You can delete a user.
NB: Since there is no database, the data is not persistent so once you reload the page, everything returns to its initial stage.
